              I like to connect with people, and recently found out being able to connect with people is a hidden talent I didn't know I had. Connecting with people, I feel is one of the main reasons of life.

              I love the show F.r.i.e.n.d.s.. My family and I could watch an entire season and laugh as if it were the first time watching it. My favorite characters was Chandler and Ross. Chandler was so funny and the king a sarcasm, and the person I relate to most. Ross' facial expressions were the best. Its funny because I'm told my facial expressions are funny too, guess its in the name.
